# Movie Review Classification

---

## The agenda is classifying the polarity of a given text at the document, sentence or feature level to find weather the expressed opinion in a movie review is positive or negative

## By using sentiment analysis, we can detect the percentage of positivity over percentage of negativity in the user entered reviews. This way, we can have a insight on what people think about our products

## Dataset Information (IMDB.csv)

### The IMDB movie dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews that are labelled as either positive or negative

### It is equally divided into 25000 reviews each for positive and negative

Dataset is available here:

## Steps

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Text Cleaning
    - Text Preprocessing
2. Modelling
    - Train-Test Split at 80/20
    - Naive Bayes
    - Logistic Regression
3. Results
    - Training Accuracy
    - Test Accuracy

## In Future

> This is a brief study comparing two common classification algorithms. It can definitely be improved.

### The following bullet points are only a few that comes to mind immediately

    - EDA could be improved by looking more into word-count statistics and review lengths.
    - Many more different classification algorithms could be compared such as Random Forest or Support Vector Machines.
